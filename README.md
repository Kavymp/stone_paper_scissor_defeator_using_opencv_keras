# stone_paper_scissor_defeator_using_opencv_keras
In this repository i tried to replicate a cool project by a japanese scientist who made a machine which had 100 % accuracy in defeating humans in the game of stone-paper and scissors using convolutional neural networks and computer vision
i have used opencv for computer vision and keras for CNNS
